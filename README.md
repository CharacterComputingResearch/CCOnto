## CCOnto: The Character Computing Ontology .
The Faculty of Media Engineering and Technology at the German University in Cairo, in collaboration with the Department for Applied Emotions and Motivation Psychology at the Ulm University, developed a Character Computing Ontology (CCOnto) to describe interactions between character states and traits and situations with behavior, as a core of the broader Character Computing framework effort.

The ontology is to be used for adaptive interactive systems to understand and predict an individual's behavior in a given situation, more specifically their performance in different tasks. The developed ontology models the different character attributes, their building blocks, and interactions with each other and with a person's behavior in different situations.([For More Details](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50316-1_34)).
