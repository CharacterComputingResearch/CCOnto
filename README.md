## CCOnto
* The Character Computing Ontology .
* We propose CCOnto, an ontology for Character Computing that models human character. The ontology is to be used for adaptive interactive systems to understand and predict an individual's behavior in a given situation, more specifically their performance in different tasks. The developed ontology models the different character attributes, their building blocks, and interactions with each other and with a person's behavior in different situations.([For More Details](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50316-1_34)).
